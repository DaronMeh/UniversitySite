    <p>One of the biggest challenges of starting university is managing your time and staying on top

    <p> Establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals can help you stay focused and motivated.

    <h1>Find a good study environment</h1>
    <p>The right study environment can make a big difference in your productivity. 
        Look for a place that is quiet, well-lit, and free from distractions. This could be a library, a quiet room at home, or a study group. </p>

    <h1>Take breaks</h1>
    <p>Taking breaks can actually improve your productivity. Step away from your work every

        <p><span>I know what you're thinking and no every hour or so doesn't mean every hour. Don't take too long of a break, or you may lose your momentum.</span></p>

    <h1>Avoid distractions</h1>
    <p>Distractions can be a major productivity killer. <span>Turn off your phone or put it on do not disturb mode while you're studying</span>,

    <h1>Stay organized</h1>
    <p>Remember what was said up top?  Keeping your notes, textbooks, and other materials organized and in a convenient place

    <h1>Get enough sleep</h1>
    <p>Speaking of blunders, now on to my greatest and most consistent. No you cant "make up for it later". I cant say it enough Sleep is important! Both for memory and concentration, 
        so make sure you get enough rest. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help you feel rested and focused. </p>
        <p><span>When you're questioning your life choices because it's 8:30 and you stayed up on your phone until 3:30, remember this moment, you were warned.</span> </p>

    <p>I know i said it twice but i want to reiterate this. If you're struggling with a concept or assignment, <span>don't be afraid to ask for help.</span> Professors, 
        tutors, and study groups are there to support you. Don't let a lack of understanding hold you back – seek help and keep moving forward. I know, <span>its embarrassing and you'll look dumb in front of everybody</span> but i guarantee at least one person has the same questions as you. Look at it this way you'll look worse failing a midterm than asking your Professor a question after class. </p>
